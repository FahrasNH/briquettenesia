        We insist on producing our own coconut shell charcoal for the majority of our briquette production and also working with a few select suppliers of high grade charcoal, to ensure that the fixed carbon content is high and ash content low. Our briquettes are perfect for use in Shisha/hookah or for barbeque, providing very high heat, long burn time and minimal ash. Due to the high quality charcoal used, our briquettes produce no smoke, odours or sparks while being burned.
